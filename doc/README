XMLTooling-J
==============================================

XMLTooling-J is a low-level library that may be used to construct libraries 
that allow developers to work with XML in a Java beans manner.  In addition
it provides a significant amount of support for more complex tasks such 
as signing and encryption, key resolution, key trust fabrics, and others.

XMLTooling-J requires working JAXP 1.3 and DOM Level 3 compliant parsers, 
which means if you are using Sun's JRE you will need to endorse JAXP compliant
libraries such as Xerces and Xalan.  XMLTooling, to date, has only been tested
on JDK 1.5 but support for 1.4 is planned for the final 1.0 release.
