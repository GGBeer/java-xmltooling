XMLTooling-J
==============================================

XMLTooling-J is a low-level library that may be used to construct libraries 
that allow developers to work with XML in a Java beans manner.  In addition
it provides a significant amount of support for more complex tasks such 
as signing and encryption, key resolution, key trust fabrics, and others.

XMLTooling-J requires working JAXP 1.3 and DOM Level 3 compliant parsers,
and this library requires the use of Xerces and Xalan for historical reasons.
We recommend those libraries be endorsed using the endorsement override
mechanism in the JVM to ensure their use.

The use of JDK 1.6 or higher is required. Older Java versions are not
supported.
